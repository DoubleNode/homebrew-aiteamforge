# AITeamForge Homebrew Tap - Overview

**Status:** Phase 2 Complete - Core Infrastructure Ready
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2026-02-17

---

## What We Built

This Homebrew tap provides the packaging and distribution mechanism for the aiteamforge environment. It follows a **two-layer architecture**: the framework layer (managed by Homebrew) and the working layer (managed by the user).

---

## Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

**Layer 1: Framework (Homebrew-managed)**
- Location: `$(brew --prefix)/opt/aiteamforge/libexec/`
- Content: Read-only template files, core scripts, documentation
- Management: Installed via `brew install aiteamforge`, upgraded via `brew upgrade aiteamforge`
- Immutable by users

**Layer 2: Working Directory (User-managed)**
- Location: `~/aiteamforge` (or custom location)
- Content: User configurations, kanban data, generated scripts, team configs
- Management: Created by `aiteamforge setup`, preserved across framework upgrades
- Fully mutable by users

This separation allows:
- Clean upgrades without losing user data
- Multiple installations with different configs
- Easy rollback to previous framework versions
- Clear distinction between "product" and "data"

---

## Components

### 1. Homebrew Formula (`Formula/aiteamforge.rb`)

**Purpose:** Defines how to install aiteamforge via Homebrew

**Key Features:**
- Declares dependencies (Python, Node.js, jq, gh, Git)
- Specifies installation URL and version
- Copies framework files to libexec
- Creates bin stubs for main commands
- Includes caveats (post-install instructions)
- Provides test block for CI validation

**What it does:**
1. Checks dependencies
2. Downloads release tarball
3. Installs to `$(brew --prefix)/opt/aiteamforge/libexec/`
4. Creates executable stubs in `$(brew --prefix)/bin/`
5. Shows post-install instructions

**What it does NOT do:**
- Configure teams
- Set up kanban system
- Modify user shell configs
- Start services

---

### 2. Main CLI (`bin/aiteamforge-cli.sh`)

**Purpose:** Command dispatcher that routes subcommands to appropriate handlers

**Commands:**
```bash
aiteamforge setup       # Run setup wizard
aiteamforge doctor      # Health check
aiteamforge status      # Show environment status
aiteamforge upgrade     # Upgrade components
aiteamforge start       # Start environment
aiteamforge stop        # Stop environment
aiteamforge restart     # Restart environment
aiteamforge version     # Show version info
aiteamforge help        # Show help
```

**How it works:**
- Exports `AITEAMFORGE_HOME` (framework location)
- Exports `AITEAMFORGE_DIR` (working directory)
- Routes to appropriate script based on subcommand
- Checks if configured before allowing most commands
- Falls back to help on unknown commands

---

### 3. Setup Wizard (`bin/aiteamforge-setup.sh`)

**Purpose:** Interactive configuration and installation wizard

**Modes:**
- `--interactive` (default) - Interactive setup
- `--upgrade` - Upgrade existing installation
- `--uninstall` - Remove configuration
- `--non-interactive` - Scripted setup

**What it does:**
1. Shows banner and intro
2. Checks dependencies (Python, Node, iTerm2, Claude Code, etc.)
3. Offers to install missing dependencies
4. Asks for installation directory
5. Checks for existing installation
6. Copies framework files to working directory
7. Creates configuration marker
8. Shows next steps

**What it will do (future):**
- Team selection (iOS, Android, Firebase, etc.)
- LCARS Kanban setup
- Fleet Monitor configuration (optional)
- LaunchAgent installation
- Shell integration
- Claude Code agent configuration

---

### 4. Health Check (`bin/aiteamforge-doctor.sh`)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive diagnostics and health monitoring

**Check Categories:**
- **Dependencies** - Python, Node, jq, gh, Git, iTerm2, Claude Code, Tailscale
- **Framework** - Framework installation, core scripts, core directories
- **Config** - Working directory, configuration marker, templates
- **Services** - LCARS server, Fleet Monitor, LaunchAgents
- **Permissions** - Write access, execute permissions

**Output:**
- ✓ Pass (green) - Check succeeded
- ⚠ Warn (yellow) - Non-critical issue
- ✗ Fail (red) - Critical issue

**Options:**
- `--verbose` - Detailed diagnostic output
- `--fix` - Attempt automatic fixes (future)
- `--check <component>` - Check specific component only

## Installation Flow

### User Perspective

```bash
# 1. Add tap
brew tap DoubleNode/aiteamforge

# 2. Install framework
brew install aiteamforge

# 3. Run setup wizard
aiteamforge setup
  # Checks dependencies
  # Installs missing deps (if approved)
  # Chooses installation location
  # Copies framework files
  # Creates config marker
  # Shows next steps

# 4. Verify health
aiteamforge doctor

# 5. Use aiteamforge
aiteamforge start ios
aiteamforge status
```

## Technical Decisions

### Why Two Layers?

**Problem:** Homebrew formulas reinstall to the same location on upgrade, which would overwrite user data.

**Solution:**
- Framework layer = immutable product code
- Working layer = mutable user data
- Setup wizard bridges the two

**Benefits:**
- Clean upgrades via `brew upgrade aiteamforge`
- User data preserved across upgrades
- Multiple working directories possible
- Clear separation of concerns

### Why Setup Wizard?

**Problem:** Complex environment with many machine-specific settings.

**Solution:** Interactive wizard that:
- Checks dependencies first
- Guides through configuration
- Generates machine-specific files
- Validates installation

**Alternative Considered:** Post-install hook
**Why Not:** Homebrew post-install runs as root, can't easily prompt user, no interactive capabilities

### Why Doctor Command?

**Problem:** Complex installation with many failure points.

**Solution:** Comprehensive health check that:
- Validates all dependencies
- Checks framework integrity
- Verifies configuration
- Tests services
- Provides actionable feedback

**Inspiration:** `brew doctor`, `npm doctor`, `cargo doctor`

## Maintainer Notes

### Releasing a New Version

1. Update version in `Formula/aiteamforge.rb`
2. Tag main aiteamforge repo: `git tag v1.0.0`
3. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
4. Calculate new SHA256 of release tarball
5. Update formula SHA256
6. Test installation
7. Commit formula update
8. Tag tap repo: `git tag v1.0.0`

### Testing Formula Changes

```bash
# Always test locally before pushing
brew audit --strict Formula/aiteamforge.rb
brew install --build-from-source aiteamforge
brew test aiteamforge

# Test uninstall/reinstall
brew uninstall aiteamforge
brew install aiteamforge
```

### Common Issues

**Formula not found:**
```bash
brew untap DoubleNode/aiteamforge
brew tap DoubleNode/aiteamforge
```

**SHA256 mismatch:**
- Download fresh tarball
- Recalculate: `shasum -a 256 file.tar.gz`
- Update formula

**Test failures:**
- Check test block in formula
- Verify files actually installed
- Check permissions
